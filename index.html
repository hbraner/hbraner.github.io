      <p><strong>BALDWIN:</strong> “You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read.

      <p><strong>DOSTOEVSKY:</strong> “Above all don’t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him or around him, and so loses <em>all respect for himself</em> and others and having no respect <strong>he ceases to love.</strong>”</p>
